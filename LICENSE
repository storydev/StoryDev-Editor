The StoryDev Editor is copyrighted under relevant international copyright laws and
UK copyright legislation.

By using the source code of this software or the executable binaries, or any
derivatives thereof, and included with it the documentation files, you agree 
to be bound by the terms of this license "Agreement".

For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Editor" - this project and any related source
code - shall be construed as the Editor, and "Server" - an alternative, yet to be
developed software application that can be used in conjunction with the Editor - shall
be construed as the Server. In both definitions, this also includes any documentation
files.

The Server software itself, when released as a binary under a proprietary license,
may be used in conjunction with the Editor to perform tasks suitable in teams of one or
more people. The Server software may perform any or all of the following tasks:

 1. Establish "Communication Protocols" that allows back and forth communication between
    the Server and Editor.
 2. As above, "Communication Protocols" are networking communications, whether over the
    Internet or via the use of a LAN network, in whole or in part, using relevant
    communication methods to produce messages for either the Editor or Server that
    subsequently performs a particular task.
 3. Through these Communication Protocols, the Server would perform the storage, maintenance,
    backup, restore and modification of files and database transactions, including but not
    limited to:
 3.1 User Management - login credentials, access privileges and control mechanisms.
 3.2 Task Management - manage and create tasks, lists and write comments on to collaborate
     in a team on any given project with this Server software.

By using the Editor, you agree to the following terms:

 1. Any and all source code, either in its original form or derivatives thereof, excluding
    derivatives developed by a third party, shall be bound by this Agreement.
 1.1 We will not be held liable for any malicious code, found in the source or binaries of
     derivatives developed by a third party.
 1.2 Where you are the owner or contributor to a derivative of this Editor, you agree that
     all sections in this Agreement shall remain in force.
 2. You may release derivative forms of this Editor, as long as the release does not
    include the release of the Server software or any derivatives thereof, or copycat source 
    code or binaries that assume the role of the Server even if entirely source code of your own.
 3. You may use this Editor for its intended purposes, including but not limited to the development
    of personal or commercial projects, no matter its form, with or without attribution to
    this Editor or the creators or contributors of this Editor.
 4. You may not sell, trade or distribute electronic copies of this Editor or derivatives thereof, 
    whether in whole or in part, including on a physical medium such as a disc, hard drive or 
    other electronic storage device, for a commercial purpose.
 5. All projects developed through the use of the Editor, are free to be used or distributed
    for any purposes, including for a commercial gain, without restriction and may be sublicensed,
    relicensed, copied, sold, modified and published and without any conditions or requirements.
